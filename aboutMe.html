        <h3>My Favorite Memory:</h3>
        <p>
            One of my favorite memories was when I visited the Japanese Friendship Garden
            in San Diego, California. I went there last summer with two of my friends. The
            weather was super beautiful, and I loved seeing all of the plants. There was a
            path that led us downhill, which meant that when we reached the bottom and looked
            up, we could only see nature around us instead of the city. It was a super unique,
            immersive experience that I will never forget!
